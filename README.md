# Loan Approval System

This repository contains the code for a **Loan Approval System** built using machine learning.
The model evaluates loan applications based on various factors and determines whether a loan should be approved or not.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install all required libraries using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/SergKhachikyan/Loan_approval_kaggle.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

cd Loan_approval

3. Install the required dependencies:
   
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the code and start predicting loan approvals based on the input data.

## How It Works

- The system uses a machine learning model (you can mention the specific model you're using, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Input features like applicant's age, income, credit score, and loan amount are processed to predict whether the loan will be approved or rejected.
